# Dojo Reflex

This is a redesign of the Coding Dojo learning application.  We gave students new interactions, access to instructors and better data visualizations.  Inctructors were given a real time view of students progress and new tools to help students that might be falling behind.  A new browsable alumni network shows students where they are headed and easy accesss to contacts in the industry.      

## Motivation

This was built during a one week sprint at Coding Dojo bootcamp. The goal was to create a fully
functional app highlighting as much of the ruby on rails as possible.

### Installing

```
gem install rails
bundle-install
```

install all the seed data
```
rake db:seed
```

Start the server!
```
rails server
```


and hope for the best.
